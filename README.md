Our Awesome crappy database project

About the skeleton.tex document. It should be compiled with pdflatex in this directory because I 
was unsure how to specifically hardcode the directories for images and queries. 
Change the name of the skeleton.tex document to myreport.tex . Git will ignore your report.


This is all Ariel Rosenfeld, Jason Chalom, Avnish Desai and Jonah Hooper's group work for Database Fundamentals.
It is a private repository to keep our code safe until the course is over.
Then we will reevaluate the license.
